    # On mac/linux
    python3.12 -m venv venv
    # or
    python3 -m venv venv
    # On Windows 
    python -m venv venv
    
    # On mac/linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On windows
    ./venv/Scripts/activate
    ```

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Setup Server for Online Play

1. Run The server
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```
    
2. Run your client
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    
You can run multiple client on a single computer. 

Although it's not required, you may also share the server with your friends by configuring the ip address instead of using localhost.
