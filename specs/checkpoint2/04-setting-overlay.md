Prequisite: [Overlay](01-overlay.md), [Setting Components](02-setting-components.md)
No points will be given if your prequisite is not full score!

- [ ] (0.25) Create a new Overlay for Setting inside the Game Scene
- [ ] (0.25) Implement Slider to change the Audio between 0 and 100 inside the Setting Overlay
- [ ] (0.5) Implement Save & Load buttons inside the Setting Overlay

Hint: Inside src/core/managers/game_manager.py there are 2 functions: save and load and it's already implemented. You can trace them and call the API when the button is clicked.

Bonus: You can also modify save and load functions to store and retrieve additional data (Might be helpful for future features).
